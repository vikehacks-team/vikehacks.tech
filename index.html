                No worries! It is not uncommon for people to come into the hackathon without an already-formed group,
                but we'll make sure you're matched with the right people! We will find a team formation and ideation
                session the first night so everyone can find the perfect team and come up with awesome ideas., so don't
                worry about first-time hackers! Teams can be up to four people. While you may work as an individual, we
                highly encourage collaborating with others. If you don't have a team or need help finding one, make sure
                not to miss our team formation and ideation session.
