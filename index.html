                No worries! It is not uncommon for people to come into the hackathon without an already-formed group,
                but we'll make sure you're matched with the right people! We will find a team formation and ideation
                session the first night so everyone can find the
                perfect team and come up with awesome ideas., so don't worry about first-time hackers! Teams can be up
                to four people. While you may work as an individual, we highly encourage collaborating with others. If
                you don't have a team or need
                help finding one, make sure not to miss our team formation and ideation session.
