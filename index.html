                        <p>No worries! VikeHacks is the perfect time to learn how to code and all students, regardless of skill level and experience, are welcome. There will be plenty of mentors on hand glad to answer any and all questions and workshops
                            specifically designed for those with no prior experience. Stay tuned for more information about workshops!
